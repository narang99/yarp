/**
 * Algorithm:
 * - enumerate all files that are part of this python package
 * - create a node for each of these that can be inserted in the graph
 * - insert all nodes in the graph, without doing dependency analysis
 * - add all nodes in the second pass, but with dependency analysis this time, creating edges
 *   - this operation can add new nodes that are not present in the graph too
 * - Topologically sort the graph, call to_destination for each node
 * - create bootstrap scripts
 *
 * All file types
 * - python file inside a site-packages folder
 * - unknown file inside a site-packages folder
 *   - both have same handling (plain file basically)
 * - plain file inside prefix
 *   - the handling is similar to site-packages, other than destination in final directory
 * - dylib inside prefix
 *   - handling same as dylib, but destination different
 * - dylib inside exec_prefix
 *   - again, handling same as dylib, but destination different
 * - dylib in site-packages
 *   - again, handling same as dylib, but destination different
 * - might be useful to have a destination object in these files i think
 * - finally we have pythonexe, which has same handling as dylib, but destination is different
 *
 * We call all of these binary file
 *
 *
 * - binary file (with destination)
 * - plain file (with destination)
 *
 * reals is same for both, how they are symlinked to correct location is different
